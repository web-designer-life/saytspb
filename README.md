## _Website for a website promotion company in St. Petersburg_
I've worked with Gulp, Sass, BEM, Flexbox. 
In this project, sliders are implemented using library Swiper(https://swiperjs.com/). 
The animations on the website were implemented using the Animate.css library(https://animate.style/), and the wow.js library(https://wowjs.uk/) was used to animate the elements on the site when the user saw them. 
The validate plugin (https://jqueryvalidation.org/) was used to validate the forms.
